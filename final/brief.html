    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>I will update the Game On! project, because it has been the most fun to work on.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>For my project, I plan to majorly improve the visual design, as it is the part that can help my game build its unique personality.</p>
    <p>To do this, I plan on adding more custom illustrations and animated reactions when buttons are pushed. For example, if a user decides to roll the die again, instead of immediately popping up images, I want to add a transition that makes the process smoother. Without them, everything feels too abrupt, and there is no flow.</p>
    <p>I've already included sound into my original design, but I would like to expand them to help immerse the user even more. I plan to make the audio on my own, then layer multiple files to create depth. It will make things more interesting but won't distract from the game.</p>

    <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
    <p>To get further feedback, I will test my game with two friends who have extensive experience in visual and UX design.</p>
    <p>Since they are my close friends and have no association with the class, I am sure they will be brutally honest with me. There's no better way to recieve feedback than by friends who find pleasure in making fun of you.</p>
