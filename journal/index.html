        <h2>Overlays Design Patterns</h2>

        <p>
          I read the article “<a
            href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c"
            >Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a
          >” by Naema Baskanderi. I do not have much experience designing
          overlays, and to be honest, I do not think of them much. I am glad I
          am gaining more awareness of their existence, because I will
          inevitably have to design them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most times, I do not have any issues with overlays on websites I
          interact with. The only time they are noticeably annoying is when
          there is no way to exit out of them without inputting your email
          address or paying for a subscription. If that happens, I immediately
          leave the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          After reading the article, at least now I know what to include and
          avoid. For example, for accessibility reasons, there should be
          multiple ways to close the overlay, such as a ‘close’ button, an ‘x’
          icon, and if ‘esc’ is on the keyboard clicked. The location of
          overlays is also important. They should be positioned closer to the
          top of the screen in case they are cut off on mobile and should not
          take up more than 50% of the screen. These are all helpful tips to
          consider.

        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>

        <p>
          It's funny that, regardless of how much everyone hates filling out
          forms, they are still required in so many places. I wonder if we will
          eventually come up with a better design for them altogether rather
          than only finding ways to improve the current format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The article
          <a
            href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"
            >"Best practices for form design"</a
          >
          by Salim Ansari was an informative read, though. As a UX designer,
          it's always my goal to make even the most boring design processes
          pleasant. Many of the listed practices were familiar to me, such as
          distinguishing between optional and required inputs, ideal label
          placement, and providing form feedback. However, practices like asking
          easy questions first, sizing fields accordingly, and minimizing
          dropdown menus were refreshingly new tips.
        </p>

        <p>
          My main takeaway is that to create the best type of form, one in which
          a user is willing to fill out, you must make it easy and simple.
          Making a form tab-ready or providing a matching keyboard is a perfect
          example of this. It's really no different than any other exemplary
          designs, at least in Western culture. I especially love
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/new-advertiser"
            >LinkedIn’s forms</a
          >
          as it exemplifies all of the best practices Ansari recommends, from
          using guiding placeholder text to a productive action button.

          />
          <figcaption>Example of LinkedIn form</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          From this point forward, I will always keep in mind to NEVER overthink
          a form. Simple (but instructive) is truly best.
