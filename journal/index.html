        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>

        <p>
          It's funny that, regardless of how much everyone hates filling out
          forms, they are still required in so many places. I wonder if we will
          eventually come up with a better design for them altogether rather
          than only finding ways to improve the current format.

          The article
          <a
            href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"
            >"Best practices for form design"</a
          >
          by Salim Ansari was an informative read, though. As a UX designer,
          it's always my goal to make even the most boring design processes
          pleasant. Many of the listed practices were familiar to me, such as
          distinguishing between optional and required inputs, ideal label
          placement, and providing form feedback. However, practices like asking
          easy questions first, sizing fields accordingly, and minimizing
          dropdown menus were refreshingly new tips.

          My main takeaway is that to create the best type of form, one in which
          a user is willing to fill out, you must make it easy and simple.
          Making a form tab-ready or providing a matching keyboard is a perfect
          example of this. It's really no different than any other exemplary
          designs, at least in Western culture. I especially love
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/new-advertiser"
            >LinkedInâ€™s forms</a
          >
          as it exemplifies all of the best practices Ansari recommends, from
          using guiding placeholder text to a productive action button.

          From this point forward, I will always keep in mind to NEVER overthink
          a form. Simple (but instructive) is truly best.
