        <h2>Game Design Research</h2>

        <p>
          For this learning journal, I read the article “<a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best
          Practices</a>” by Amir Dori. In the article Dori discusses the best design
          practices for game apps.
        </p>

        <p>
          I do not play as many games now as I did when I was younger, so it was
          a refresher to see all the examples Dori includes throughout the
          article. Many of his tips are quite interesting and useful, such as
          ‘Avoid the X’ and when to flash the ‘Rate Us’ pop-up.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main thing I disliked about the article was how innately
          capitalistic it is. I understand that at the end of the day, these
          game companies are businesses who need to profit, which explains why
          these best practices emphasize monetization. But, almost all of them are
          elements of dark UX, used to extort as much money as they can from
          users. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, it is hard to escape that designers are hired to create better user experiences to profit companies. This article makes it clearer for me to avoid these types of industries as much as I can, honestly.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/miyajima.jpeg"
            alt="Miyajima Shrine"
            width="500"
            height="667"
          />
          <figcaption>Victoria, 2023</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This is an image of a shrine on Miyajima island. This image actually
          includes a much deeper story as to how I got there. I was studying
          abroad in Fall ‘23 in the UK, but decided to take a solo trip to Japan
          nearing the end of the quarter in December. I decided to root myself
          in three major cities, Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka, and take day trips to
          neighboring cities. I took a 2-hr bullet train from Osaka to
          Hirashima, then a ferry from Hirashima to the island. It was a perfect
          day, and although you can not tell from the image, there were many
          other tourists and even deer there. I was able to stay for the sunset,
          and it was beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
          This image relates to my archive because it was a special moment in my
          trip, as I had never been on a trip on my own before. The fact that I
          had gotten to this island reflected my growing independence and
          confidence.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/pink.jpeg"
            alt="Scattered clothes, accessories, and makeup"
            width="500"
            height="409"
          />
          <figcaption>Evie, 2023</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This image is a collection of my peer’s clothes, accessories, and
          makeup. The most interesting aspect of this image is how she laid out
          all of her items in an organized chaotic way. The fact that all of her
          objects were also color coordinated speaks loudly about her aesthetic.
          The most obvious aspect of the image is how it tells the story of how
          my classmate likes to present herself. I can tell she likes to dress
          femininely. The most mysterious part is how she came about acquiring
          these clothes and accessories. Since everything is so cohesive, there
          must have been a time when it was not so orderly, maybe a time when
          she was still discovering herself.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>

        <p>
          In this day and age, images have never been such a common way to
          communicate messages. Even with videos, which are thousands of moving
          images. Though, with the amount of content I consume, I do recognize
          that I often skip out on learning the context of this media before
          moving on to the next. This is because the vast amount of information
          has diminished my ability to focus on what is in front of me. The need
          for constant stimulation means I want to view the newest visuals out
          there.
        </p>

        <p>
          To learn how to remove myself from this habit, the article “<a
            href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"
            >10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual
            Thinking Skills</a
          >,” by the New York Times was helpful in providing tips. The writing
          piece was geared towards teachers to implement better image observing
          methods, but I can also heavily implement them in my life, such as to
          notice details and expand my knowledge of the world. Prioritizing tiny
          details in photos gives me time to stop and cherish the time I take to
          learn. Expanding my knowledge provides greater explanation for an
          image in a broader context. For example, like in the article,
          understanding that it does not snow heavily in Ireland, may make
          images of high snow piles in the country surprising.
        </p>

        <p>
          A website I found to use images in a visually appealing way is a
          <a href="https://reksaandhika.com/">portfolio site</a> by an
          Indonesian designer, Reksa Andhika. Moving the cursor around the
          screen spawns images of his work. Hovering over case study images
          reveals the inverted colors of the same photos. It is an interesting
          way to get users to interact with different elements on the page, as
          you never know what lies underneath.

        <h2>Overlays Design Patterns</h2>

        <p>
          I read the article “<a
            href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c"
            >Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a
          >” by Naema Baskanderi. I do not have much experience designing
          overlays, and to be honest, I do not think of them much. I am glad I
          am gaining more awareness of their existence, because I will
          inevitably have to design them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most times, I do not have any issues with overlays on websites I
          interact with. The only time they are noticeably annoying is when
          there is no way to exit out of them without inputting your email
          address or paying for a subscription. If that happens, I immediately
          leave the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          After reading the article, at least now I know what to include and
          avoid. For example, for accessibility reasons, there should be
          multiple ways to close the overlay, such as a ‘close’ button, an ‘x’
          icon, and if ‘esc’ is on the keyboard clicked. The location of
          overlays is also important. They should be positioned closer to the
          top of the screen in case they are cut off on mobile and should not
          take up more than 50% of the screen. These are all helpful tips to
          consider.

        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>

        <p>
          It's funny that, regardless of how much everyone hates filling out
          forms, they are still required in so many places. I wonder if we will
          eventually come up with a better design for them altogether rather
          than only finding ways to improve the current format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The article
          <a
            href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"
            >"Best practices for form design"</a
          >
          by Salim Ansari was an informative read, though. As a UX designer,
          it's always my goal to make even the most boring design processes
          pleasant. Many of the listed practices were familiar to me, such as
          distinguishing between optional and required inputs, ideal label
          placement, and providing form feedback. However, practices like asking
          easy questions first, sizing fields accordingly, and minimizing
          dropdown menus were refreshingly new tips.
        </p>

        <p>
          My main takeaway is that to create the best type of form, one in which
          a user is willing to fill out, you must make it easy and simple.
          Making a form tab-ready or providing a matching keyboard is a perfect
          example of this. It's really no different than any other exemplary
          designs, at least in Western culture. I especially love
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/new-advertiser"
            >LinkedIn’s forms</a
          >
          as it exemplifies all of the best practices Ansari recommends, from
          using guiding placeholder text to a productive action button.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Example of LinkedIn form</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          From this point forward, I will always keep in mind to NEVER overthink
          a form. Simple (but instructive) is truly best.
