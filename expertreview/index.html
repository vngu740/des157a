    <h1>Final Project Process Work</h1>

    <h2>Who critiqued your work and what qualifications do they possess that makes their opinions on design valid?</h2>
    <p>Our instructor, William Mead, and my designer friend (not a classmate) critiqued my work. They both have experience within visual design, which is my target for improving my MadLibs project.
    </p>

    <h2>Design critique notes: what is strong and what can be improved in terms of visual design for the project.
    </h2>
    <p>Both critiques mentioned that my Willy Wonka theme is strong and funny, but there could be more done to improve the small details. For example, they mentioned that my chocolate bar design doesn’t read as a candy bar at first glance. William Mead suggested that I can make my inputs read more as nutritional facts on the back of a chocolate bar to make it more obvious. He also suggested improving the CSS of my submit button. 
    </p>
    <p>My graphic design friend thought I could add more moving elements so that it wasn’t so static, for example a glitter effect on the golden ticket page. She also suggested that it would be more interesting to include more illustrations of characters from the movies, like Oompa Loompas.</p>

    <h2>Include at least one image from your project, marked up with improvements to be made.
    </h2>
